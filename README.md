# Get Groovy

The app is a social media platform for music lovers, where users can share their current or last listened to song with others in a post format. This allows users to discover new music and connect with others who have similar taste in music. 

# What We Learned

My team and I implemented a QR code scanner feature using the camera, which allowed us to learn about using the camera in a mobile app. We also implemented a profile picture feature using either the camera or the photo library, which taught us how to access and use the device's camera and photo library. A nonSQL database was used by my team and I to store user data such as posts, followers, accounts they are following, reactions to a post, usernames, and passwords, which taught us how to store and retrieve data in a nonSQL database. My team and I utilized the Spotify API to retrieve song information, play songs when the play button is clicked, add songs to the user's liked playlist when the like button is pressed, retrieve the song's cover art, the song's name, and the artist's name, which taught us how to use external APIs to access and retrieve data in the app. We also used another API to generate unique QR codes for each user, which taught us how to use external APIs to access and retrieve data in the app. Overall, this project allowed my team and I to gain experience in various aspects of mobile app development, such as camera integration, database management, and API integration.


# Problems/Errors We Faced

When creating the app, one of the main challenges was getting the Spotify API to work with authentication and it double authenticating. Additionally, keeping the user logged in even after the app was closed completely was also a difficult task. Another challenge was getting the profile picture to save and work properly. Making the app compatible with IOS was also a difficult task, especially when trying to get the Spotify API to work properly on the platform.

In terms of things that could have been improved, one issue was that when scrolling through posts, the song information would reload each time it came on the screen instead of already being loaded. Another feature that would have been nice to add but was not possible due to time constraints or technical limitations was a song preview on the posts.
